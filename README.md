# ðŸ“š Book Store Application
I have always loved books, especially those that help understand the meaning of human existence and provide fuel for thought. Inspired by this passion, I decided to create my own application, where users can purchase books from the comfort of their homes.

# ðŸŽ¯ Application Overview
This application provides functionalities for managing users, books, categories, orders, and shopping carts. The system ensures secure access with role-based authorization (USER and ADMIN). The app is designed for book sales, allowing users to:

Create accounts and log in.
Purchase books conveniently and quickly from home.
Track the status of orders and know when they arrive at the post office.
This is my first large-scale application, and I faced numerous challenges during its development. Each part was difficult but immensely educational, and I gained a lot of knowledge that will be invaluable for my future projects.
